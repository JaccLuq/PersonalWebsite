            <h2>Secure File Sharing</h2>
            <p>Designed a system that allows users to securely store and share files in the presence of attackers. Utilized language-based security mechanisms, such as cryptographic encryption, hash functions, and authentication protocols to ensure efficient and secure operation of the application. Developed optimized algorithms to enhance runtime efficiency, successfully meeting key performance benchmarks.</p>

            <h2>Pintos OS</h2>
            <p>Used Pintos, an educational operating system, to develop a functional kernel. Added core functionality with argument passing, essential syscalls, and floating point operations. Added support for multi-threaded user programs, specifically implementing an efficient alarm clock and strict
                priority scheduler. Implemented features to the file system of Pintos, including the addition of a buffer cache to speed up accesses to
                disk.</p>
